# 👋 Hi, I’m Xiangnuan (向暖)

A full-stack developer from China 🇨🇳 with 10 years of experience in big data, e-commerce, and online education.  
I’ve led large front-end teams, building projects like data monitoring and micro-frontends.

Lately, I’ve been diving deep into Web3 and AI Agents — loving how blockchain and smart tech can create real impact.  
I’ve joined multiple hackathons and worked hands-on across different blockchains, turning ideas into real products.
